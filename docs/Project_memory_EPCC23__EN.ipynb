For some years now, different audience research agencies, such as the British The Audience Agency, or MHM Insights, with its Culture Segments, have been developing cultural audience segmentation studies based on new parameters linked to the personality, desires and interests of people, which are not necessarily directly linked to demographic factors. Along these lines, and based on surveys of cultural practices carried out by the Generalitat de Catalunya, I have attempted to approach this approach by trying to discover new patterns of cultural interests and consumption. To do so, I have based myself on the K-Means clustering.\n",

In this sense, and based on the same survey, I have tried to make a regression model that makes it possible to **predict what volume of culture a user of a given profile will consume**."

Once this was done, I also contrasted each target with its composition in demographic terms, observing how some demographic variables were distributed similarly, or not, between the groups. And it has been interesting to observe how many traditional variables such as age, gender or income were not determinant in them.\n",

From this new clustering, 5 differentiated groups or clusters have emerged that respond to a large extent, but not entirely, to the 5 clusters of the first analysis.\n",

The latter revealed similarities but also new elements with respect to the previous clusterisations.\n",

As a result, we not only see how these demographic characteristics vary from one clustering to another, but also how there are factors that are less relevant and remain stable in different clusters."
